As your primary customer interface, the Shopify storefront must be a high-performance revenue engine. I maneuver this critical touchpoint to maximize conversion and longevity by solving common barriers to growth: slow performance, rigid content, and the inability to effectively test and personalize the customer experience.

## Core Capabilities

My service delivers a powerful, flexible, and fully optimized foundation that scales with your business.

### Performance & Web Vitals

I am dedicated to achieving and exceeding Shopify's highest Lighthouse standards. I eliminate Liquid inefficiencies, ensure lightweight component loading, and enforce best-in-class Core Web Vitals. The result is a user experience that minimizes bounce rates and maximizes your organic search visibility.

### Data & Content Syndication

Rigid, hard-coded content obstructs growth. I implement custom metafields, metaobjects, and API integrations to power dynamic page sections and product data. This robust data syndication capability gives your marketing and content teams granular, code-free control over site-wide content reuse, essential for managing large catalogs and complex content campaigns.

### Conversions & A/B Testing Setup

I build themes with conversion science at their core, setting up the necessary architecture to enable effortless A/B testing on key page elements. This also includes implementing advanced non-intrusive smart merchandising and personalization hooks within the theme to dynamically promote products and collections based on real-time customer behavior.

### Accessible & Future-Proof Foundation

Every theme I deliver adheres to modern WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards and established web best practices. By focusing on a clean, maintainable architecture, I future-proof your investment, ensuring the theme remains performant and scalable through future platform updates without requiring continuous major overhauls.

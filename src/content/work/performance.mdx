Performance isn't just a technical metricâ€”it's a critical factor in your conversion rate and organic ranking. I specialize in the deep, technical optimizations that move your Lighthouse scores into the A-range. My work goes beyond standard audits; I engineer custom solutions within the theme to ensure sustained speed, mobile-first responsiveness, and complete technical SEO compliance, directly translating faster load times into higher revenue.

## Core Optimization Capabilities

I eliminate front-end friction and build for long-term site health.

### Advanced Liquid & Front-End Engineering

I resolve the core inefficiencies that plague complex Shopify themes. This includes deep Liquid optimization, custom solutions for pagination that bypass platform limitations (e.g., looping, re-ordering, and conditionally displaying items across multiple blogs without JavaScript), and engineering lightweight alternatives to heavy content, such as custom A-to-B image animation sections to replace demanding GIFs and videos.

### Image Rendering & Core Web Vitals

Achieving top Core Web Vitals requires a standards-based approach to assets. I implement correct image rendering and optimization using native browser lazy attributes. I've developed custom loading strategies that look ahead to content below the fold to precisely determine when window.load is ready, ensuring image efficiency that surpasses generic replacement libraries like Lazysizes.

### Technical SEO & Structured Data

I conduct comprehensive Lighthouse and SEO audits to identify every bottleneck. To streamline data management, I developed a custom Google Structured Data snippet that replaces fragmented, component-level snippets. This single, unified solution makes population and updates easy, ensuring your site consistently delivers rich results and maintains technical compliance.

### Mobile-First User Experience

I build storefronts with an uncompromising focus on mobile responsiveness and design. My process includes deeply considering how a user might interact differently on a mobile device versus a desktop, leading to custom layouts (e.g., conditional content displays like 10 items on mobile vs. 20 on desktop for faster perceived loading) that drastically improve the mobile shopping experience.

## Case Study: Division Road, Inc.

### Overview

Division Road, Inc., needed to replace its depreciated Shopify theme, which had become a major bottleneck for site speed and conversion. The project was framed as a complete performance overhaul to achieve A-grade Lighthouse standards and future-proof the site against Core Web Vitals changes.

### Key Performance Challenges

- Low Core Web Vitals: The deprecated theme resulted in a Lighthouse Performance score of 35, severely impacting SEO and user experience.
- Inefficient Codebase: Identified and replaced all depreciated features and code from 2015 to eliminate slow-loading Liquid and unnecessary JavaScript dependencies.
- Architectural Overhaul: The new theme architecture was specifically designed to enforce native browser lazy-loading and minimal rendering cost, addressing all major speed concerns.


### Performance-Driven Features

While custom features were implemented, they were all built with a strict performance budget in mind. Key features included:

- Image Optimization: Ensured correct rendering and lazy-loading implementation across all dynamic content.
- Conversion Optimization: The custom cart section and related content blocks were Liquid-optimized to be non-render-blocking, preserving speed at the most critical stage of the funnel.

### Result: Measurable Impact on Revenue

- Lighthouse Performance Score: 95 (up from 35)
- Accessibility Score: 98 (up from 83)
- Visual Stability: +96%
- Site Search Conversion: +189%
- Online Visitors: +69%
- Sessions: +23%
- Bounce Rate: -18%

## Challenge

Building and maintaining a cohesive design system across multiple Shopify themes can be challenging. We needed a centralized way to build, share, and maintain reusable UI components, moving away from cluttered vanilla JavaScript and large, monolithic CSS files.

## Solution

I implemented a modern development workflow using Vite to compile and minify our JavaScript and CSS components into Shopifyâ€™s theme format. This tooling ensures a single source of truth for our component library, leading to a more consistent user experience, faster development cycles, and improved code maintainability across all themes.

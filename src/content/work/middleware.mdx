When off-the-shelf apps can't meet your business rules, you need custom infrastructure built to integrate seamlessly with Shopify. I specialize in middleware solutions that connect Shopify to your essential business systems (ERP, CRM, WMS) or extend its capabilities with entirely new applications, using robust, battle-tested back-end technologies like Ruby on Rails and Astro.

## Core System Architecture Capabilities

I build the critical bridge between Shopify and the rest of your ecosystem, eliminating data silos and automating complex workflows.

### Custom Logic & Business Rules Engine 

Your business doesn't fit a template, so your platform shouldn't either. I architect and develop dedicated applications (often in Ruby on Rails) that act as a custom commerce logic engine. This is where I implement unique requirements—like dynamic commission structures, multi-vendor dashboards, custom subscription tiers, or complex product variant rules—that are impossible to manage within the Shopify admin alone.

### Data Synchronization & API Integration 

I establish resilient, real-time data flow between Shopify and third-party systems like ERP, PIM, CRM, or specialized fulfillment platforms. This ensures absolute data consistency across inventory, customer records, and order fulfillment. My solutions include robust monitoring, job queues, rate limiting, and webhook retry logic to guarantee system uptime and data integrity under high load.

### Headless & Decoupled Commerce Back-End 

For merchants seeking the speed and flexibility of a Headless setup, I architect the necessary back-end and API layer. Using modern frameworks like Astro for high-performance front-ends, I decouple your storefront from Shopify's rendering, connecting it instead to a dedicated middleware layer (e.g., Rails, Sanity) for lightning-fast performance and unified content/commerce control.

### Multi-Vendor & Advanced Marketplace Foundation

I design the full technical stack required to launch and scale a custom marketplace solution. This includes all phases of development, from building vendor-specific dashboards and Stripe Connect Express payment processing (including 1099 reporting logic) to implementing the necessary wildcard domain logic for unique vendor storefronts.

# System Architecture in Practice

## Work In Progress: Multi-Vendor Shopify MVP

This project represents the breadth of my middleware expertise—building a comprehensive, custom marketplace that leverages Shopify for commerce while offloading complex logic to a dedicated back-end.

### Technical Stack Highlights

* Logic Engine: Ruby on Rails (PostgreSQL)
* Front-End: Astro (Headless), TailwindCSS, Motion
* Data & CMS: Shopify Admin API, Shopify Storefront API, Sanity (Content)
* Payment & Hosting: Stripe Connect Express, Fly.io, Cloudflare

### Strategic Problem Solved

The client requires a self-sustaining multi-vendor platform with custom user roles, unique storefront branding for each vendor, and complex, automated commission and tax reporting—all while utilizing Shopify's checkout and core catalog features.

### Key Milestones Delivered (Current Phase)

- Foundation: Rails application initialized with custom User/Vendor authentication (Devise) and core data models (Product, Order, etc.).
- Connectivity: Initial integrations with Shopify Admin API and Stripe Connect Express configured for seamless data exchange.
- Deployment: Environment established on Fly.io and Cloudflare with initial database configuration.

### Next Steps

Implementation of the Vendor-facing dashboard, building endpoints for real-time data synchronization, and beginning development on the high-speed Astro front-end for vendor storefronts.
